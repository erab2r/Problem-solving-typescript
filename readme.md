Do not use hardcoded outputs. Your solutions must work with different valid inputs.
Consider edge cases, input constraints, and time and space complexity.
For in-place problems, modify the input array as required instead of returning a newly created array when the function signature specifies void.
Test your solutions with the provided examples and additional test cases.
Organize your code using comments to identify each problem clearly.
Problem 1: Staircase
Problem Description
You are given an integer n, representing the height of a staircase. Your task is to construct a right-aligned staircase using the # character and spaces.
The staircase must contain exactly n rows. Each row should contain the appropriate number of leading spaces followed by # characters. The first row contains one #, and each subsequent row contains one additional # until the final row contains n characters.
Each row must be separated by a newline character (\n). Do not include unnecessary spaces at the end of any row.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var staircase = function(n) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
n = 4
Output:
  #
  ##
 ###
####
Example 2
Input:
n = 1
Output:
#
Problem 2: Grading Students
Problem Description
A teacher has assigned grades to a group of students. The grading system allows grades to be rounded according to the following rules:
If a grade is less than 38, it remains unchanged because it is below the minimum passing grade.
If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to that next multiple of 5.
Otherwise, keep the original grade unchanged.
Given an array of student grades, return a new array containing the final grades after applying these rules independently to each student.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} grades
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var gradingStudents = function(grades) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
grades = [73, 67, 38, 33]
Output:
[75, 67, 40, 33]
Explanation:
73 is rounded to 75 because the difference is 2.
67 remains unchanged because the difference to 70 is 3.
38 is rounded to 40 because the difference is 2.
33 remains unchanged because it is below 38.
Example 2
Input:
grades = [84, 29, 57]
Output:
[85, 29, 57]
Problem 3: Time Conversion
Problem Description
You are given a time string in 12-hour clock format, including hours, minutes, seconds, and an AM/PM suffix.
Convert the given time into its equivalent 24-hour clock format.
The 24-hour format uses hours from 00 through 23 and does not include an AM/PM suffix.
Remember the following special cases:
12:xx:xxAM becomes 00:xx:xx.
12:xx:xxPM remains 12:xx:xx.
Any other PM hour must be increased by 12.
Other AM hours remain unchanged.
Return the converted time as a string in HH:MM:SS format.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var timeConversion = function(s) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
s = "07:05:45PM"
Output:

"12:30:45"
Problem 4: String Repeat
Problem Description
Given a non-negative integer n and a string s, return a new string formed by repeating s exactly n times.
The resulting string must preserve the original order of the characters in s. If n is zero, return an empty string.
You may use built-in string methods or implement the repetition using a loop.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var repeatStr = function(n, s) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
n = 3, s = "ha"
Output:
"hahaha"

n = 0, s = "hello"
Output:
""
Example 3
Input:
n = 4, s = "a"
Output:
"aaaa"
Problem 5: Reversed Strings
Problem Description
Given a string str, return a new string containing the same characters in reverse order.
The first character of the original string must become the last character of the result, and the last character of the original string must become the first character.
The original string must not be modified. An empty string should return an empty string.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @return {string}
 */
var solution = function(str) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
str = "world"

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove duplicate values in-place so that each unique value appears exactly once.
The relative order of the unique elements must remain unchanged.
After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements, k. The first k positions of nums must contain the unique elements in sorted order.
You must modify the original array without creating another array to store the unique values.
The contents of nums beyond index k - 1 do not matter.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {

};
Examples

Problem 14: Move Zeroes
Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, move all occurrences of zero to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of all non-zero elements.
You must perform this operation in-place, without creating another array for the result.
For example, if the input is [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], the non-zero elements must remain in the order 1, 3, 12, and all zeros must be placed after them.
Your function should modify the original array and return nothing.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void}
 */
var moveZeroes = function(nums) {

};

Problem 15: Merge Sorted Array
Problem Description
You are given two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, along with two integers m and n.
nums1 has a total length of m + n. Its first m positions contain valid elements, while the remaining n positions are initialized to zero and reserved for the merged result.
nums2 contains exactly n valid elements.
Merge the elements of nums2 into nums1 so that the final array contains all m + n elements in non-decreasing order.
The merge must be performed directly in nums1. Do not return a separate merged array.
Important: The zeros reserved at the end of nums1 are empty positions, not necessarily actual input values.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void}
 */
var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {

};

Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, find all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that the indices are distinct and the sum of the three corresponding values is zero.
Formally:
[
nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0
]
Your solution must satisfy the following requirements:
Each triplet must contain three elements whose sum is exactly zero.
The same array element cannot be used more than once in a single triplet.
The result must not contain duplicate triplets, even if the input contains repeated values.
The order of the triplets in the final result does not matter.
Return an array containing all valid unique triplets. If no valid triplets exist, return an empty array.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var threeSum = function(nums) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output:
[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

Input:
nums = [0, 0, 0]
Output:
[[0, 0, 0]]
Problem 17: Plus One
Problem Description
You are given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer.
Each element contains a single digit, and the digits are arranged from the most significant digit to the least significant digit. The integer does not contain leading zeros, except when the number itself is zero.
Increment the represented integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
You must correctly handle carry propagation. For example, adding one to a number ending in 9 may require carrying into the preceding digit. If every digit is 9, the resulting array will contain one additional digit.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {number[]} digits
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var plusOne = function(digits) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
digits = [1, 2, 9]
Output:
[1, 3, 0]

Example 2
Input:
digits = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output:
[4, 3, 2, 2]
Example 3
Input:
digits = [9, 9, 9]
Output:
[1, 0, 0, 0]
Problem 18: Reverse String
Problem Description
You are given an array of characters s. Reverse the order of the characters in the array.
The reversal must be performed in-place, meaning you must modify the original array without creating another array to hold the reversed characters.
The function should return nothing. After the function executes, the original array must contain the characters in reverse order.
Consider using two pointers: one starting at the beginning of the array and another at the end.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {string[]} s
 * @return {void}
 */
var reverseString = function(s) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
Output after modification:
["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
Example 2
Input:
s = ["H", "a", "n", "n", "a", "h"]
Output after modification:
["h", "a", "n", "n", "a", "H"]
Problem 19: Length of Last Word
Problem Description
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is defined as a maximal sequence of non-space characters. Words are separated by one or more spaces.
The string may contain leading spaces, trailing spaces, or multiple consecutive spaces between words. These spaces must not affect the length of the last word.
Your function should return the number of characters in the final word, excluding any surrounding spaces.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
s = "Hello World"
Output:
5
Explanation: The last word is "World", which contains five characters.
Example 2
Input:
s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "

4
Explanation: The last word is "moon".
Example 3
Input:
s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output:
6
Problem 20: Longest Common Prefix
Problem Description
Given an array of strings strs, find the longest common prefix shared by every string in the array.
A prefix is a sequence of characters that appears at the beginning of a string. The common prefix must match across all strings, character by character, starting from index zero.
If the strings do not share any common starting characters, return an empty string.
If the array contains only one string, that entire string is the longest common prefix. If any string is empty, the longest common prefix must also be empty.
Function Signature
/**
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string}
 */
var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {

};
Examples
Example 1
Input:
strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output:
"fl"
Explanation: All three strings begin with "fl", but their next characters differ.
Example 2
Input:
strs = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output:
""
Explanation: There is no common prefix shared by all three strings.
Example 3
Input:
strs = ["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"]
Output:
"inter"
